THE SDK IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE FREE OF CHARGE, AND ON AN "AS IS" BASIS AND "WITH ALL FAULTS", WITHOUT ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM AFFINA. LICENSEE ASSUMES THE RISK THAT THE SDK IS SUITABLE OR ACCURATE FOR LICENSEE NEEDS AND LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SDK IS AT LICENSEE’S OWN DISCRETION. AFFINA AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES FOR THE SDK, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE OR QUIET ENJOYMENT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS,  AS IT RELATES TO AN IP INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM, IN NO EVENT SHALL AFFINA (OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS) BE LIABLE IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES IN ANY AMOUNT EXCEEDING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($500,000).

9. Termination  

Either party may terminate this License upon providing thirty (30) days’ written notice.  Either party may also terminate this License effective immediately if the other party materially breaches this License after the non-breaching party has given written notice to the other party of such breach, and the breaching party fails to cure such breach within ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice. Upon the termination of this License, and after the Wind-Down Period (as defined below), the rights and licenses granted to Licensee by Affina pursuant to this License will terminate.   Upon the termination of this License, Licensee will have a limited period of twelve (12) months after such termination (the **“**Wind-Down Period**”**) to continue exercising the license rights granted under this License in order to affect an orderly phase-out of the Licensee Products which incorporate the SDK, except if the cause of the termination was Licensee’s breach of Sections 2 or 3\. Licensee may terminate the Wind-Down Period early upon written notice. The termination of this License for any reason shall not affect the validity of any existing licenses to Combined Products granted by Licensee or its distributors or resellers during the term of this License and the Wind-Down Period and Licensee is not required to destroy any Combined Products to the extent the SDK (or parts thereof) were embedded in the Combined Products prior to the end of the Wind-Down Period and (b) recall any Combined Products that are in Licensee’s distribution channels as of the end of the Wind-Down Period. Sections 1 (Definitions), 3.a. (Confidentiality), 6 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 7 (Waiver of consequential damages; Limitation of Liability), 7a. (Indemnity), 8 (Termination), and 9 (General) shall survive any termination of this License. 

 

10. General  

This License is not intended to establish any partnership, joint venture, employment, or other relationship between the parties except that of independent contractors. As used in this License, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” If any provision of the License is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the parties agree that such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the remaining provisions of the License will remain in full force and effect. Any notice given under this License must be in writing by email to the following addresses (or addresses notified in writing by either party): to Licensee and to Affina: mbaker@affinaloyalty.com. Neither party is liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations (except for the payment of money) on account of declared war, fires, flood, storm, earthquakes, or any other acts of God which is beyond the reasonable control of that party. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its choice of law rules.  The parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware; provided, however, that either party may pursue claims against the other party in any other jurisdiction worldwide to enforce its intellectual property rights. This License contains the complete agreement between Licensee and Affina with respect to the subject matter of this License, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral or written; including, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms and conditions that may be contained in the SDK Documentation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this License, any modifications of this Agreement must be in writing and executed by both parties. With respect to the subject matter hereof, this License takes precedence over any and all terms accompanying Affina Products and services, or provided by Affina online, even if such terms are presented to, and accepted by, Licensee after the Effective Date of this Licensee.  This License may not be assigned by either party without the prior written approval of the respective other party. Any attempted assignment, transfer, or delegation of duties or obligation without such prior written consent will be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may assign this License, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, upon written notice to the other party and without obtaining such consent, (a) to any Affiliate of such party; or (b) in connection with any reorganization, merger, divestiture, or acquisition, or any sale of all or substantially all of such party’s assets or business related to this License. “Affiliate” means, with respect to a party, any person or entity that, at any time during the term of this License, directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such party, where “control” means ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities (but only as long as such person or entity meets these requirements). This License may be executed and delivered by e-mail and in counterparts, and will be considered as original and whole if so executed and delivered.
